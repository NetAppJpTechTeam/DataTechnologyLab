# CREATE PULL REQUEST AND MERGE STRATEGY



## Fork upstream and clone your fork.

- git clone https://GITHUB/USER/REPO.git
- cd REPO
- git remote add upstream https://GITHUB/UPSTREAM-OWNER/REPO.git
- git remote -v

## Work on pull request in a new topic branch.

- git checkout -b TOPIC-BRANCH
- git add FILES
- git commit
- git push origin TOPIC-BRANCH

## Go to your fork on GitHub, switch to the topic branch, and
## click *Compare & pull request*.

---
After the pull request merged.

## Keep your fork's main development branch updated with upstream's.

- git fetch upstream
- git checkout master
- git merge upstream/master
- git push origin master

## Delete topic branch branch after pull request is merged.

- git checkout master
- git branch -D TOPIC-BRANCH
- git push -d origin TOPIC-BRANCH
